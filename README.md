# Trans-Arctic_WAIs

author: eva luedke

This repository contains the code behind "Tracking Wintertime Trans-Arctic Warm and Moist Air Intrusions in Past, Present, and Future Climate".
It is structured as follows: 

- src: contains all functions as .py files
- plot: contains all python notebooks (.ipynb) that contain plots
- csv: contains csv files as input files
